/* ===== JavaScript practice  =====*/
/* Our first JavaScript command
The name of this command is “alert.” It creates a pop-up window with a text that we can specify.
Inside of the parentheses we will write a text that we want to be displayed in a pop-up. */

// alert("Hello, World!");
// alert("How are you?");
// alert("Have a nice day!");

/* We can write the alerts on the same row but It's important to add semicolons after each command. 
Now we add semicolons after each command. Then save it and refresh the page.
And we see that everything works, because JavaScript first will run this command from
alert till semicolon, then this alert command till semicolon and finally this.
That’s why it’s better to follow the rule, that after command you should write a semicolon. */

// alert("Hello, World!"); alert("How are you?"); alert("Have a nice day!");

// confirm('Are you 18 years of age or older?');

// let isAdult = confirm('Are you 18 years of age or older?');
// console.log(isAdult);



// Naming Rules for Variables 

// Wrong way to declare a variable
// let poet = "Walt Whitman";

// Good way to declare a variable (Camel Case or Camel style)

// let fullNameOfPoet = "Walt Whitman";

// Variable names can begin with letters, with a dollar sign or even with an underscore.

// On the other hand, in JavaScript you can’t begin the name of a variable with a number or an ampersand sign.

/* Also, JavaScript is case-sensitive, 
meaning that in the following example: score (with all lowercase letters), 
and Score (with a capital S) 
and SCORE (in all caps) are not the same variables. */

// Prompt

// let name = prompt('Enter your name', 'Anonymous');
// console.log(name);



// let firstName = prompt('Your first name:', '');
// let lastName = prompt('Your last name:', '');
// let age = prompt('Your age:', '');

// console.log('Hello, '+firstName+' '+lastName+'. You are '+age+' years old.');


// Task 2
let a = 5;
let b = "r";
console.log(a==="5" || b === "r");
